title: Data Preparation & Feature Selection for Predicting Length of Stay

This project uses Python to demonstrate the steps for cleaning and preparing a dataset with multiple variables and data types, and then selecting the appropriate features that contribute to a specific outcome; in this case, hospital length of stay.

The dataset contains about 32,000 patients with data consisting of patient demographics, diagnoses, medical history, and vital signs. This data is fictitious, but represents true clinical outcomes and values.

Firstly, I love Python so much, here is some code!

```
my_love_for_python = 0
my_python_knowledge = 0

for day in lifetime:
    my_love_for_python += 1
    my_python_knowledge += 1
```

Just so you really see how much I love Python, here is some code BUT with some colours for keywords & functionality!

```python
my_love_for_python = 0
my_python_knowledge = 0

for day in lifetime:
    my_love_for_python += 1
    my_python_knowledge += 1  
```

Here is an **unordered list** showing some things I love about Python

* For my work
    * Data Analysis
    * Data Visualisation
    * Machine Learning
* For fun
    * Deep Learning
    * Computer Vision
    * Projects about coffee

Here is an _ordered list_ showing some things I love about coffee

1. The smell
    1. Especially in the morning, but also at all times of the day!
2. The taste
3. The fact I can run the 100m in approx. 9 seconds after having 4 cups in quick succession

I love Python & Coffee so much, here is that picture from the top of my project AGAIN, but this time, in the BODY of my project!

The above image is just linked to the actual file in my Github, but I could also link to images online, using the URL!

A line break, like this one below - helps me make sense of what I'm reading, especially when I've had so much coffee that my vision goes a little blurry

I could also add things to my project like links, tables, quotes, and HTML blocks - but I'm starting to get a cracking headache.  Must be coffee time.
